# Floodgate
## What is Floodgate?
Floodgate is a hybrid mode plugin that allows Minecraft: Bedrock Accounts to join Minecraft: Java Edition servers without needing a Minecraft: Java Edition account. 
This is something you install in addition to Geyser. Unlike Geyser, Floodgate can only be installed as a plugin on Spigot (including Paper and forks), Bungeecord, and Velocity, and can only be utilized on servers that have it installed.

## What has Floodgate 2.0 to offer?
Floodgate 2.0 is a rewrite of Floodgate 1.0, with various bugfixes and improvements. It also introduces new features: being able to [see Bedrock player skins on Java edition](Features#What-is-skin-uploading),
being able to [use Bedrock forms](Forms), link your account once and login on every server that has [Global Linking](Features#What-is-Global-Linking) enabled,
and the [Global Api](Features#What-is-the-Global-Api).
