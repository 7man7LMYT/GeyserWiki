6. If you join successfully, then you are done! Make sure to leave the playit.gg program running as closing it will close the tunnel. (If you failed to join, check out the [troubleshooting](/geyser/setting-up-playit-gg/#troubleshooting) section of the page.)

## Troubleshooting

### I can't connect to my server!
* *Make sure to check [here](/geyser/fixing-unable-to-connect-to-world/) beforehand.*
* *If you changed the port that Geyser would bind to, you'll have to tell playit.gg to use that port instead in the image below.*

* *(Alternatively: You can try setting the* `bedrock` `port` *in the Geyser configuration to* `19132`.)
